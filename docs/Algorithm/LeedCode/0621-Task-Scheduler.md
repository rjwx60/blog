#### [621. Task Scheduler](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/task-scheduler/)

### 一、Content

You are given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done without the original order of the array. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.

You need to return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

给定一个用字符数组表示的 CPU 需要执行的任务列表。其中包含使用大写的 A - Z 字母表示的26 种不同种类的任务。任务可以以任意顺序执行，并且每个任务都可以在 1 个单位时间内执行完。CPU 在任何一个单位时间内都可以执行一个任务，或者在待命状态。

然而，两个相同种类的任务之间必须有长度为 n 的冷却时间，因此至少有连续 n 个单位时间内 CPU 在执行不同的任务，或者在待命状态。

你需要计算完成所有任务所需要的最短时间。



#### 1-1、Example

```
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.



Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.



Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
Output: 16
Explanation: 
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A
```



#### 1-2、Note

The number of tasks is in the range [1, 10000].
The integer n is in the range [0, 100].
